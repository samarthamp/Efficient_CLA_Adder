# VLSI_Project
This is complete repository for the S2024 - VLSI Design Course Project. 
The project was to design an efficient and fast CLA adder and write the required Spice files, Make the complete layout in Magic editor, Write the required Verilog files.
Then finally to implement it in the hardware, we burn the verilog files onto the FPGA Board.
